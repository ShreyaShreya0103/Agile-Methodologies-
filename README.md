Exploring Agile and Scrum Methodologies

In our presentation, we introduced Agile, a methodology that emerged in the early 2000s to speed up software delivery, focusing on flexibility and customer collaboration. We discussed key Agile frameworks, including Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP), highlighting their unique approaches to project management. Scrum, with its structured roles and regular ceremonies, emphasizes teamwork, transparency, and adaptability through iterative development cycles known as Sprints. We also explored the Agile Manifesto and its 12 principles, which guide teams to prioritize people, deliver functional software, and adapt to change. Finally, we compared Agile with other frameworks, discussing implementation strategies, benefits, challenges, and emerging practices to help organizations achieve successful Agile transformations.
